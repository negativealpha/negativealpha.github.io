Hello world again. I'm learning like a newborn exploring a brand new world, but I've been
distracted because I've found my hands and they're fun to look at and put in my mouth.

I've always wanted to create a blog and code, so when I saw that you could create a blog 
hosted on Github, it felt like the pieces were coming together. This guy had a Youtube 
tutorial and a [website](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages/) and this 
[woman](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages)
had a really easy to follow tutorial on how to setup a Jekyll blog.

Still, nothing is straight forward and even writing text envolves knowing a language.

Here's a list:
- **first!**
- second
- *sassy*

Cool. Now here's a quotation (while adding a break and escaping the dash):

And pictures are great, let's post a few.
